**Theory:**

The Reflex Klystron is a microwave tube used as a microwave source in the lab. It makes 
use of velocity modulation to transform a continuous electron beam into microwave power. Its 
oscillation frequency can be varied over a wide band and it can be pulse and frequency modulated. 
Electrons emitted from the cathode are accelerated by and pass through the positive 
resonator grid towards the reflector. The reflector is at a negative voltage with respect to cathode, 
and consequently it retard and finally reflects (reflex klystron) the electrons, which then turn back 
through the resonator grids: In case the klystron starts to oscillate, a hi-field exists between the 
resonator grids. The electron travelling through the grid will be either accelerated or retarded as the 
voltage changes in amplitude. Accelerated electrons leave the grid at an increased velocity and 
retarded electrons leave at a reduced velocity. Because of the difference in velocity the electrons 
leaving the grids will need different time to return (i.e., have different transit times).As a result of 
returning electron group together in bunches. This variation in velocity of the electrons is called 
velocity modulation.

As the electron bunches pass through the resonator grids, they interact with the voltage 
between the grids. If the bunches pass through the grids at a time such that the electrons are 
slowed down by the grid voltage energy will be delivered to the resonator and the klystron will 
oscillate. Strongest oscillation will occur when transit time in the reflector resonator region n + 
¾ cycles of the resonator frequency, where ‘n’ an integer is including zero. If the bunches pass 
through the grids at a time such that the electrons are accelerated by the voltage, energy will be 
removed from the resonator and no oscillations will occur.

**PROCEDURE**
1. Connect all components as per Fig. A.

2. Set klystron power supply controls:

3. Mode switch → AM

4. Beam voltage → Min (fully anticlockwise)

5. Repeller voltage → Max (fully clockwise)

6. Meter switch → Beam Current

7. Rotate the frequency meter to one side slowly.

8. Switch ON klystron power supply, VSWR/CRO, and cooling fan; wait 1–2 minutes.

9. Adjust beam voltage to set beam current around 20 mA (must not exceed 30 mA).

10. Switch meter to Repeller Voltage and reduce repeller voltage; note output power and frequency.

11. For frequency measurement, keep klystron in AM mode and view output on CRO; rotate the frequency meter to find the dip and record its frequency.

12. Increase beam voltage slowly and set VSWR meter to maximum deflection.

13. Adjust repeller voltage for maximum VSWR reading.

14. Rotate frequency meter slowly to find the minimum output on the VSWR meter.

15. Read the frequency directly between the two horizontal fine marks.

16. Change repeller voltage and repeat if required.

**Mechanical and Electronic Tuning:** 
Mechanical tuning depends on changing the width of cavity i.e. the effective I 
capacitance and thus the resonant frequency of the klystron changes. The power output remains 
same with tuning. 
Electronic tuning refers to change in repeller voltage causing a change in output 
frequency. However, the power output also changes. A measure of electronic tuning is given by 
‘Electronic tuning Sensitivity (ETS)’. This can be determined by taking the slope of the 
frequency characteristic of the modes.

**CALCULATIONS:**
1. Tuning range of 1 ¾ mode is

Po = 10(x/20) watts, where x is dB reading in 
VSWR meter. 

2. By taking the values of repeller voltage we can calculate the the mode number 
N1 = n + ¾ with V2 = 
N2 = (n +1) + ¾ 
with V1 = 
N1 & N2 are respective modes numbers.

4.  ETS (Electronic Tuning Sensitivity) = f2 - f1 / V2 – V1 MHz / V

**Conclusion:** 

The mode characteristics of the reflex klystron were successfully studied. The different oscillation modes were identified by varying the repeller voltage and observing the corresponding output frequency and power. The electronic tuning range (ETR) and electronic tuning sensitivity (ETS) were calculated from the frequency variations. The experiment verified that the oscillation frequency of a reflex klystron depends on the repeller voltage and that maximum power occurs at specific mode conditions. Thus, the reflex klystron effectively demonstrates velocity modulation, bunching, and electronic tuning principles.
